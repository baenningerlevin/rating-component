## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this section I learned how to use the `.foreach`-Method:

```JavaScript
rates.forEach((rate) => {
  rate.addEventListener('click', () => {
    rates.forEach((btn) => {
      btn.classList.remove('active');
    });

    rate.classList.add('active');

    ratingEl.textContent = rate.textContent;
  });
});
```

### Continued development

I still have to learn a lot about JavaScript, especially about methods and how to write clean code.

Meanwhile I have got pretty good with writing HTML and CSS. I can see patterns way quicker than before.
